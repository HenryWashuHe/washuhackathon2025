```

### 📋 Documentation Created

- **LANGGRAPH_TEAM_WORK.md** - Complete team work guide
- **backend/README.md** - Backend API documentation

---

## 🚀 Next Steps for Your Team

### Step 1: Setup (Everyone - 10 min)

```bash
# 1. Navigate to backend
cd backend

# 2. Create Python environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Create .env file
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env and add: OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

### Step 2: Assign Work (4 People)

**Open this file:** `LANGGRAPH_TEAM_WORK.md`

It has complete instructions for each person!

| Person | Agent | File | Time | Complexity |
|--------|-------|------|------|-----------|
| 1 | Meteorologist | `agents/meteorologist.py` | 45-60 min | Medium |
| 2 | Agronomist | `agents/agronomist.py` | 45-60 min | Medium |
| 3 | Economist | `agents/economist.py` | 45-60 min | Medium |
| 4 | Planner | `agents/planner.py` | 60-75 min | Hard |

### Step 3: Work Independently (45-75 min)

Each person:
1. Open your assigned file
2. Look for `# TODO` comments
3. Implement the methods
4. Test your agent
5. Commit when done

### Step 4: Integration (30 min)

Together:
1. Merge all code
2. Test full pipeline
3. Fix any issues

### Step 5: Frontend Connection (30 min)

Update `src/app/api/analyze/route.ts` to call FastAPI backend instead of AI SDK.

## 📊 What Each Agent Does

### 1. Meteorologist Agent (Person 1)
**Input:** Location coordinates  
**Does:** Fetches real climate data from Open-Meteo API  
**Outputs:** Temperature, precipitation, weather risk  
**File:** `backend/agents/meteorologist.py`

**Key Tasks:**
- Implement API call to Open-Meteo
- Calculate precipitation anomalies
- Assess extreme weather risk
- Create 3+ claims with confidence scores

---

### 2. Agronomist Agent (Person 2)
**Input:** Climate data from Meteorologist  
**Does:** Analyzes agricultural impacts  
**Outputs:** Yield changes, water stress, crop recommendations  
**File:** `backend/agents/agronomist.py`

**Key Tasks:**
- Calculate crop yield impacts
- Assess water stress (0-1 scale)
- Generate 3-5 crop recommendations
- Create claims about agricultural impacts

---

### 3. Economist Agent (Person 3)
**Input:** Climate + agricultural data  
**Does:** Analyzes economic impacts  
**Outputs:** Income changes, adaptation costs, resilience scores  
**File:** `backend/agents/economist.py`

**Key Tasks:**
- Calculate income impact from yield changes
- Estimate adaptation costs
- Assess economic resilience
- Create 4+ economic claims

---

### 4. Planner Agent (Person 4) ⭐ Most Complex
**Input:** All previous agent outputs  
**Does:** Synthesizes into actionable strategy  
**Outputs:** Optimized crop mix, irrigation plan, final recommendations  
**File:** `backend/agents/planner.py`

**Key Tasks:**
- Extract metrics from all agents
- Generate balanced strategy considering priorities
- Calculate impact (food, income, emissions, risk)
- Compile top 5-7 recommendations

## 🔧 How LangGraph Works

```python
# LangGraph chains agents automatically:

User Request
     ↓
Meteorologist (gets climate data)
     ↓
Agronomist (analyzes agriculture using climate data)
     ↓
Economist (analyzes economics using agro + climate data)
     ↓
Planner (synthesizes everything into strategy)
     ↓
Response Streamed Back
```

**State Management:**  
LangGraph passes a shared `AgentState` object through all agents. Each agent:
1. Receives the state
2. Performs analysis
3. Updates the state with outputs
4. Passes to next agent

---

## ✅ Testing Checklist

**After everyone finishes their agent:**

### Individual Testing
```bash
cd backend
python test_agent.py  # Test your agent
```

### Full Pipeline Testing
```bash
# Terminal 1
python main.py  # Start server

# Terminal 2
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "location": {"lat": -1.286, "lng": 36.817, "name": "Nairobi"},
    "radius": 100,
    "priorities": {"economic": 50, "environmental": 50, "social": 50}
  }'
```

**Expected Output:**  
Server-Sent Events stream with messages from all 4 agents

---

## 📚 Key Files to Read

1. **Start here:** `LANGGRAPH_TEAM_WORK.md` - Complete work guide
2. **Backend docs:** `backend/README.md` - API and architecture
3. **Your agent file:** Look for `# TODO` comments
4. **Data models:** `backend/models/schemas.py` - Understand the data structures

---

## ⏱️ Timeline

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 0-10 min | Everyone: Setup Python environment |
| 10-70 min | Independent: Implement your agent |
| 70-100 min | Together: Test and integrate |
| 100-130 min | Together: Connect to frontend |
| 130-150 min | Final testing and demo |

**Total:** ~2.5 hours to working system

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Read the TODOs carefully** - They have hints and examples
2. **Test as you code** - Don't wait until the end
3. **Use helper methods** - Already provided in each agent
4. **Check schemas.py** - Shows exact data structure
5. **Ask teammates** - You're working on different files (no conflicts!)
6. **Commit often** - After each working method

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Individual Agent Success:
- [ ] All TODO methods implemented
- [ ] Agent returns proper data structure
- [ ] Claims have confidence scores
- [ ] Natural language message generated
- [ ] No import/syntax errors

### Integration Success:
- [ ] All 4 agents run in sequence
- [ ] State passes between agents correctly

## 🚀 Ready to Start?

1. **Everyone run setup** (Step 1 above)
2. **Read:** `LANGGRAPH_TEAM_WORK.md`
3. **Open your agent file**
4. **Start coding!**
5. **Test individually**
6. **Integrate together**

---

## ❓ Questions?

**Can't find your file?**
- Make sure you're in the `backend/` directory
- Check `backend/agents/yourname.py`

**Import errors?**
```bash
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)"
```

**Don't understand LangGraph?**
- Don't worry! Just implement the `analyze()` method
- LangGraph handles the orchestration automatically
- Focus on your agent's logic

**Git conflicts?**
- Unlikely - everyone works on different files
- If it happens: Person 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 merge order

---

## 🎉 You're All Set!

The backend structure is **100% complete**. Each agent file has:
- ✅ Skeleton code
- ✅ Helper methods
- ✅ TODOs with clear instructions
- ✅ Type hints
- ✅ Examples

Just fill in the TODOs and you'll have a working LangGraph multi-agent system!

**Next:** Open `LANGGRAPH_TEAM_WORK.md` and assign agents to your teammates! 🚀
